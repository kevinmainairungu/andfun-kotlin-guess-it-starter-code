# Application Architecture - The UI Layer - Guess It!

## Guess It!

Guess It is a word guessing app you can play with one or more friends. To play, hold the device in landscape, facing away from you with your thumbs on the **Skip** and **Got It** buttons. Your friends can then give you clues to help you guess the word. 

If you get the word right, press **Got It**. If you're stuck, press **Skip**. The game runs for a minute and then shows you your score.
